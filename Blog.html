    What happens inside the brain of a Depressed person?
    <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For people who experience depression, the size of
    specific regions of the brain can decrease, the shrinkage may be reversible
    though. Following parts of the brain can be affected:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Hippocampus</b> - It has a major role in learning and memory. Studies
    have shown that it also gets affected in a variety of neurological and
    psychiatric disorders.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Thalamus</b> - It's involved in many high-level functions such as speech,
    thought, behavioural reactions, learning, and movement. Because it links
    sensory input to positive and negative feelings, depression can affect the
    thalamus, which can get smaller in those diagnosed with depression.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Amygdala</b> - In depression, the amygdala is overactive and responds
    excessively to negative events. In turn, the amygdala connects to a set of
    brain regions that hone the physiological and behavioural response to
    emotional stimuli.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Prefrontal Cortices </b>- They manage attention, impulse control, and
    emotional reactions. In brain-imaging studies using PET scans, depressed
    people display abnormally low activity in the prefrontal cortex.
    <br />

    What happens inside the brain of a person with Anxiety?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The brain is made up of two hemispheres, the right and the left. Both the
    sides are connected by a bundle of fibres. Communication between the right
    and left happens along these fibres, but during anxiety, the messages don't
    flow smoothly. The Amygdala and the Hippocampus play significant roles in
    most anxiety disorders
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Amygdala </b>- A structure deep in the brain that can alert the rest of
    the brain that a threat is present and trigger a fear or anxiety response.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Hippocampus</b> - The part of the brain that encodes threatening events
    into memories.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Stress-Hormone Boost</b> - Responding to the signals from the
    hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands pump out high
    levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
    <br />
    <br />
    In addition, certain parts of the brain become dominant and drive behaviour.
    This is evidence of a strong, healthy brain switching into survival mode,
    but during anxiety it happens too much and unnecessarily. It's not just the
    feeling of being restless rather some of the physical effects include a racy
    heart, sick stomach, clammy skin, vomiting, shaking of hands and legs.
    <br />
    <br />
    All this is because of the surging of these neurochemicals, the natural end
    to the fight or flight response is intense physical activity. When there is
    no need to fight or flee, there is nothing to burn up the neurochemicals and
    they build up, causing the physical symptoms of anxiety. This is not under
    your control, and you should not be blamed for it, neither should you feel
    guilty for feeling the way you do. What should be normalized is asking for
    help, and then actually receiving it without experiencing all the stigma and
    discrimination, to not get shame for an actual illness that cannot be
    controlled. Mental Health Disorder is an actual concern around the globe.
