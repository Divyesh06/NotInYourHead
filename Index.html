<p>Often described as just something that's all in your head or just an emotion. Mental health disorders have a
  significant impact on someone's physical health as well, so much that it becomes extremely difficult to carry on about
  a day. It's usually ignored because it's perceived as just a random thought or experience that won't last long which
  couldn't be any more wrong. This is not just an emotion, it's not just a thought, it's an experience that no one
  should have to endure. Especially not alone. </p>

  <h2>What makes it worse</h2>
  <p>One of the things that makes someone's mental state much dreadful is hearing about how it'll pass before you even
    know it. This is because people ask questions like why do you feel the way you do? Asking them to describe their
    trauma makes them relive it and does more damage than one realizes. On top of everything else there lies stigma and
    discrimination surrounding mental health disorders.</p>

  <h2>It's okay</h2>
  <p>What people need to understand is that it is not their fault, it's not something that they can just control or just
    stop feeling at that particular instant. To understand it better, you should know that it's not a feeling, rather
    it's the imbalance of chemicals in the brain, not just that some other important factors include family history and
    genetics, as well as life experiences, psychological factors can also cause mental health problems. Feeling blue at
    a certain point in someone's life if perfectly normal, it’s when it’s persistent along with some other contributing
    factors that really intervene with someone's daily life when you label it as a mental health disorder. </p>
